    "# Week 18 - MQTT\n",
    "\n",
    "**MQTT** stands for **Message Queuing Telemetry Transport**. It’s a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed for environments with low bandwidth, high latency, or unreliable networks, making it ideal for IoT (Internet of Things) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "  <span style=\"color: #0C8EE0; font-size: 20px;\">\n",
    "    <strong>Key characteristics:</strong>\n",
    "  </span>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lightweight:** Minimal overhead, suitable for small devices like sensors.\n",
    "* **Efficient**: Optimised for constrained devices and networks.\n",
    "* **Scalable:** Many devices can connect to a single broker and share data through topics.\n",
    "* **Open Standard:** Maintained by OASIS and ISO (ISO/IEC 20922).\n",
    "  \n",
    "MQTT lets devices send and receive messages efficiently without talking directly to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is widely used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Smart homes\n",
    "* IoT sensors\n",
    "* Industrial monitoring\n",
    "* Cloud-connected microcontrollers (ESP32, Pico W, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How MQTT Works\n",
    "MQTT uses a publish-subscribe architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Broker**: Central server that manages message distribution.\n",
    "* **Clients:** Devices that either publish messages to topics or subscribe to topics to receive messages.\n",
    "* **Topics:** Hierarchical strings (e.g., `home/livingroom/temperature`) used to organise messages.\n",
    "* **Transport:** Runs over TCP/IP for reliable, ordered delivery.\n",
    "* Quality of Service (QoS):\n",
    "    * 0: At most once (fast, no guarantee)\n",
    "    * 1: At least once (guaranteed, may duplicate)\n",
    "    * 2: Exactly once (guaranteed, no duplicates)\n",
    "      \n",
    "**The three main parts of MQTT**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Publisher**\n",
    "\n",
    "A device that sends data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Temperature sensor\n",
    "* RFID reader\n",
    "* Button device\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Subscriber**\n",
    "\n",
    "A device or application that receives data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dashboard\n",
    "* LED controller\n",
    "* Mobile app\n",
    "* Another microcontroller\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Broker (the Middleman / Server)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The middle server that:\n",
    "* Receives messages\n",
    "* Forwards them to subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of brokers:**\n",
    "* **Mosquitto** (open-source, very popular).\n",
    "* **HiveMQ** (cloud-based, great for learning).\n",
    "* **EMQX** (enterprise broker for large-scale IoT)\n",
    "  \n",
    "📌 Devices never talk directly to each other — everything goes through the broker.\n",

    "\n",
    "In MQTT, a topic is a named channel that messages are sent to and received from.\n",
    "\n",
    "A topic tells the MQTT broker where a message belongs and who should receive it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Devices publish messages to topics, and other devices subscribe to topics.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "HiveMQ provides a free cloud-based broker that’s secure, reliable, and ideal for small IoT projects. Unlike running a broker locally (like Mosquitto), HiveMQ Cloud takes care of hosting and TLS security for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why TLS with HiveMQ Cloud?\n",
    "TLS (Transport Layer Security) ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encrypted communication** between MQTT clients and the HiveMQ broker.\n",
    "* **Authentication** via certificates to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.\n",
    "* **Data integrity** so messages aren’t tampered with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Create a HiveMQ Cloud Account**\n",
    "1. Go to HiveMQ Cloud\n",
    "2. Click **Sign Up** and create a free account (choose the free tier plan).\n",
    "3. Confirm your email and log in to the HiveMQ Cloud Console.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Step 2: Create a Cluster (Your Broker)**\n",
    "1. Once logged in, click **Create Cluster**.\n",
    "2. Choose:\n",
    "    - Region: (e.g., Europe or US – closer region = faster connection).\n",
    "    - Tier: Select Free.\n",
    "3. HiveMQ will set up your cluster (broker) (e.g., `xxxx.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud`).\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Step 3: Create MQTT Credentials**\n",
    "1. In the cluster settings, go to Access Management → MQTT Clients.\n",
    "2. Click Create Credentials.\n",
    "3.  Set:\n",
    "    - **Username**: `pico_user1` (you choose).\n",
    "    - **Password**: `StrongPassword123!` (use something strong).\n",
    "4. Save – you’ll use these in your Pico W code to connect securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Step 4: Enable TLS (Secure Communication)**\n",
    "HiveMQ Cloud requires TLS/SSL encryption on port 8883.\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- You must connect using port 8883 (not 1883).\n",
    "- In MicroPython, the `umqtt.simple` library supports SSL with a little extra setup.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**TLS = Transport Layer Security.**\n",
    "It ensures communication between your device and HiveMQ is:\n",
    "- Encrypted → outsiders can’t read it.\n",
    "- Authenticated → your Pico knows it’s talking to HiveMQ (not a fake broker).\n",
    "- Tamper-proof → messages can’t be changed secretly on the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "TLS is like the **padlock icon**  you see in your web browser with `https://`.\n",
    "For MQTT, it means data travels in a secure tunnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Install MQTT Libraries on the Pico**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Raspberry Pi Pico W needs the MQTT libraries before running the code.\n",
    "Use MicroPython’s package installer (mip) to fetch them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mip\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install basic MQTT client\n",
    "mip.install(\"umqtt.simple\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install robust MQTT client (auto reconnect if Wi-Fi drops)\n",
    "mip.install(\"umqtt.robust\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "  </span>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "It will download and save the libraries into your Pico’s `/lib` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `umqtt.simple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `umqtt.robust` for projects that need auto-reconnects.\n",
