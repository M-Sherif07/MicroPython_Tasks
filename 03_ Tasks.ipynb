    "\n",
    "* **OFF Button:** When pressed, it turns the LED OFF.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* The system has **one button**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the button is pressed, the LED will **blink once** (turn ON for **half a second**, then OFF).\n",

    "* If the button is pressed again, the LED blinks once again — **it does not stay ON continuously**.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **A doorbell indicator light** that flashes once when pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A notification light** that blinks once when triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A one-time signal lamp** for acknowledgment in machinery.\n",

    "\n",
    "* A **button is pressed** to trigger the confirmation.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Remote control pairing**: a light blinks multiple times to confirm pairing success.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Security systems**: a lamp blinks to confirm an alarm has been armed/disarmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IoT devices**: LEDs blink in a pattern to indicate a successful Wi-Fi connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "To practice structured coding, you are required to write the **multi-blink behaviour inside a function**. The main loop should only call the function when the button is pressed.\n",

    "\n",
