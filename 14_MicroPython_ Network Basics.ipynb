    "\n",
    "**Networking in IoT (Internet of Things)** is how smart devices (sensors, controllers, boards like ESP32 or Raspberry Pi Pico W) connect and communicate with each other, gateways, servers, and cloud platforms over wired or wireless networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Networking is Important in IoT**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without networking, an IoT device is just a standalone gadget. Networking enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1️⃣ Data Sharing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensors can send real-time data such as:\n",
    "* Temperature\n",
    "* Motion\n",
    "* Light levels\n",
    "* Humidity\n",
    "\n",
    "**This data can be viewed on dashboards, apps, or websites.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2️⃣ Remote Monitoring & Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can:\n",
    "* Turn devices ON/OFF remotely\n",
    "* Monitor systems from anywhere\n",
    "* Receive alerts (email, app, SMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Turning on a fan when a room gets too hot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3️⃣ Automation & Smart Decisions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Networking allows devices to:\n",
    "* React automatically to events\n",
    "* Trigger other devices\n",
    "* Use cloud rules and logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "PIR detects motion ➡️ sends data ➡️ cloud rule ➡️ buzzer activates\n",
    "\n",
    "**4️⃣ Scalability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple devices can work together:\n",
    "* Smart homes\n",
    "* Smart classrooms\n",
    "* Smart factories\n",
    "* Smart cities\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Do We Use Networking in IoT?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔺 1. Connect Devices to a Network**\n",
    "\n",
    "Common connection methods:\n",
    "* Wi-Fi (ESP32, Pico W)\n",
    "* Bluetooth / BLE\n",
    "* Ethernet\n",
    "* LoRa / Cellular (4G/5G) for long-range\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔺 2. Use Communication Protocols**\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocols define how data is sent:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table style=\"margin-left: 0; border-collapse: collapse; width: 70%; font-size: 14px;\">\n",
    "    <tr style=\"background-color: #13BDE3;\">\n",

    "        <td>Sensor → Cloud  </td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td><b>HTTP/REST</b></td>\n",

    "**🔺 3. Send & Receive Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Devices can:\n",
    "* Publish data (temperature, motion)\n",
    "* Subscribe to commands (ON/OFF)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "* Sensor publishes: room/temp = 26\n",
    "* App sends command: fan = ON\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔺 4. Cloud & Edge Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Networking connects devices to:\n",
    "* Cloud platforms (dashboards, databases)\n",
    "* Local servers (edge computing)\n",
    "* Mobile apps and web apps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Real-World IoT Networking Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart Classroom Alarm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PIR sensor detects motion\n",
    "2. Pico W sends data via Wi-Fi\n",
    "3. MQTT sends a message to the cloud\n",
    "4. Cloud triggers an alert\n",
    "5. Buzzer or LED activates\n",
    "\n",
    "**All of this works because of networking.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Code\n",
    "````python\n",
    "import network\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "ssid = 'YourWiFiSSID'\n",
    "password = 'YourWiFiPassword'\n",
    "\n",
    "station = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)\n",
    "station.active(True)\n",
    "station.connect(ssid, password)\n",
    "\n",
    "while not station.isconnected():\n",
    "    print(\"Connecting to Wi-Fi...\")\n",
    "    time.sleep(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Connected to Wi-Fi\", station.ifconfig())\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**network.STA_IF (Station Mode):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **network.STA_IF** mode configures the Raspberry Pi Pico W as a station (client) on a Wi-Fi network.\n",
    "* In this mode, the Pico W can connect to a local Wi-Fi router, just like a laptop or smartphone would.\n",
    "* This is commonly used in IoT applications where the device needs to send data to the internet or receive commands from other devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**station.active() Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **active(True)**: This method is used to activate the network interface. Before the Pico W can connect to any Wi-Fi network, the network interface must be activated by calling active(True).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "````python\n",
    "station.active(True) enables the network interface.\n",
    "````\n",
    "**station.connect() Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **connect(ssid, password)**: This method is used to connect to a Wi-Fi network by specifying the SSID (network name) and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "````python\n",
    "station.connect(\"WiFi_Name\", \"Password\") #connects the Pico W to the specified Wi-Fi network.\n",
    "````\n",
    "**ifconfig() for Displaying IP Address:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **ifconfig()** method provides information about the network interface, including the device’s IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS.\n",
    "*  After successfully connecting to a Wi-Fi network, you can use **station.ifconfig()** to check the IP address assigned to the Pico W.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "````python\n",
    "print(station.ifconfig()) \n",
    "````\n",
    "will print details like ('192.168.1.2', '255.255.255.0', '192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.1'), where the first value is the device's IP address.\n"

    "A **sensitive credential** is any piece of information that can prove identity or grant access to something (a device, account, network, database, API, etc.). If someone gets it, they can impersonate you or use your services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Wi-Fi SSID noting “the network name” + Wi-Fi password\n",
    "* API keys (Supabase anon key, OpenWeather key, etc.)\n",
    "* Tokens (JWT, OAuth access tokens, refresh tokens)\n",

    "    <strong>How Do We Keep a sensitive credential Secret?</strong>\n",
    "  </span>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To protect sensitive credentials:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Store them in a separate file (e.g., secrets.py) instead of hardcoding in your main code.\n",
    "2. Exclude the file from version control using `.gitignore` so it’s not uploaded to GitHub.\n",
    "3. Encrypt or obfuscate the file if extra security is needed.\n",
    "4. Rotate credentials regularly to minimise risk.\n",
    "5. Limit physical access to IoT devices because anyone with direct access can read the storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`secrets.py`** is a **convention** used in MicroPython projects to store sensitive credentials separately from your main application logic.\n",
    "It typically contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example `secrets.py`:**\n",
    "````python\n",
    "# secrets.py\n",
    "WIFI_SSID = \"MyHomeWiFi\"\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stops accidental sharing:** You can share main.py with students/colleagues without exposing passwords/keys.\n",
    "* **Easier updates:** Change Wi-Fi or API key in one place.\n",

    " * An IP address\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Without Wi-Fi, nothing else works.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Supabase Provides a REST API**\n",
    "\n",
    "Supabase automatically creates a REST API endpoint for each table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "````python\n",
    "https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/customer\n",
    "````\n",
    "📌 This endpoint represents the `customer` table in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Is Prepared in MicroPython**\n",
    "````python\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    \"firstname\": \"John\",\n",
    "    \"lastname\": \"Doe\",\n",
    "    \"age\": 30\n",
    "}\n",
    "````\n",
    "✔️ This is sensor or user data stored as a Python dictionary.\n",

    "````\n",
    "✔️ MicroPython automatically:\n",

    "````python\n",
    "headers = {\n",
    "    \"apikey\": \"your-anon-key\",\n",
    "    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer your-anon-key\",\n",
    "    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n",

    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "**Headers tell Supabase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Who you are\n",
    "* Which project\n",
    "* What type of data are you sending\n",
    "\n",
    "**What each header does:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `apikey` ➡️ identifies your Supabase project\n",
    "* `Authorization` ➡️ authorises the request\n",
    "* `Content-Type` ➡️ tells the server the data is JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Without headers, Supabase will reject the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **HTTP POST Request Is Sent**\n",
    "   \n",
    "````python\n",
    "response = urequests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)\n",
    "````\n",
    " \n",
    "7. **Supabase Inserts Data into the Database**\n",
    "Supabase:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Validates the API key\n",
    "* Checks permissions\n",
    "* Inserts the data into the table\n",
    "* Sends a response back\n",
    " \n",
    "8. **Device Receives the Server Response**\n",
    "````python\n",

    "### Fetching Data from Supabase\n",
    "A GET request is used to read data from your Supabase database.\n",
    "Supabase automatically provides RESTful access to every table in your project using PostgREST.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Device Connects to Wi-Fi**\n",
    "````python\n",
    "station = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)\n",
    "station.active(True)\n",
    "station.connect(ssid, password)\n",
    "````\n",
    "✔️ This gives the device:\n",
    "    \n",
    " * Internet access\n",
    " * An IP address\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Without Wi-Fi, nothing else works.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Supabase Provides a REST API**\n",
    "\n",
    "Supabase automatically creates a REST API endpoint for each table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (fetch all custormers):**\n",
    "\n",
    "````python\n",
    "https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/customer\n",
    "````\n",
    "📌 This returns all rows from the `customer` table in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Filtering Data with Query Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can fetch specific records using filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "````python\n",
    "?id=eq.5\n",
    "````\n",
    "**Meaning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetch the row where id equals 5\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common PostgREST Operators\n",

    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Required HTTP Headers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Supabase requires headers to identify and authorise the request:\n",
    "````python\n",
    "headers = {\n",
    "    \"apikey\": \"your-anon-key\",\n",
    "    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer your-anon-key\",\n",
    "    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "````\n",
    "**Why headers matter**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `apikey` ➡️ identifies the Supabase project\n",
    "* `Authorization` ➡️ allows access to the table\n",
    "* `Content-Type` ➡️ confirms JSON format\n",
    "\n",
    "***Without headers ➡️ request is rejected***\n",
